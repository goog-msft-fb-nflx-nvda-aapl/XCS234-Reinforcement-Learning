Just as $\rho^\pi$ captures the distribution over trajectories induced by $\pi$, we can also examine the distribution over states induced by $\pi$. In particular, define the \textit{discounted, stationary state distribution} of a policy $\pi$ as, $$d^\pi(s) = (1-\gamma) \sum\limits_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t p(s_t = s),$$ where $p(s_t = s)$ denotes the probability of being in state $s$ at timestep $t$ while following policy $\pi$. Consider an arbitrary function $f: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Prove the following identity: 

$$\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \rho^\pi}\left[\sum\limits_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t f(s_t,a_t)\right] = \frac{1}{(1-\gamma)} \mathbb{E}_{s \sim d^\pi}\left[\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi(s)}\left[f(s,a)\right]\right]$$ 

\textit{Hint 1: Using your answer from part (a), try to understand the following identity $\E_{\tau \sim \rho^{\pi}}[\mathbbm{1}[s_{t}=s]] = p(s_{t} = s)$}.
\textit{Hint 2: Recall the linearity property of the expectation operator.}
