\item \points{1c}

For any policy $\pi$, we define the following function $$A^\pi(s,a) = Q^\pi(s,a) - V^\pi(s)$$ Prove the following statement holds for all policies $\pi,\pi'$: 

$$V^\pi(s_0) - V^{\pi'}(s_0) = \frac{1}{(1-\gamma)} \mathbb{E}_{s \sim d^\pi}\left[\mathbb{E}_{a \sim \pi(s)}\left[A^{\pi'}(s,a)\right]\right]$$

\textit{Hint: The result we have proven in part (b) will help simplify your derivation.}

\textit{Note: We have provided you with scaffolding for your derivation. In the provided scaffold we have substituted in our expression for $V^{\pi}(s_{0})$ from part (a). In addition, we have reexpressed $V^{\pi'}(s_{0})$ as a telescoping sum.}
