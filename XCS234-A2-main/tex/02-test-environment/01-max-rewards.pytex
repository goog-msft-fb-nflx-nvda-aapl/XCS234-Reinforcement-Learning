\item \points{2a}

What is the maximum sum of rewards that can be achieved in a single trajectory in the test environment, assuming $\gamma = 1$? Show first that this value is attainable in a single trajectory, and then briefly argue why no other trajectory can achieve greater cumulative reward. Please make reference to the properties outlined in the tables [\ref{table:test_spec_1}, \ref{table:test_spec_2}] accompanying this question and note that the episode length is 5 timesteps.
